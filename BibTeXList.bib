abstract="This relatively short chapter provides a general introduction to conformal symmetry in arbitrary dimension. Conformal transformations are introduced in Sect. 4.1, with their generators and commutation relations. The conformal group in dimension d is identified with the noncompact group SO(d + 1,1). In Sect. 4.2 we study the action of a conformal transformation on fields, at the classical level. The notion of a quasi-primary field is defined. We relate scale invariance, conformal invariance, and the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor. In Sect. 4.3 we look at the consequences of conformal invariance at the quantum level on the structure of correlation functions. The form of the two- and three-point functions is given, and the Ward identities implied by conformal invariance are derived. Aspects of conformal invariance that are specific to two dimensions, including local (not globally defined) conformal transformations, are studied in the next chapter. However, the proof that the trace T$\mu$$\mu$vanishes for a two-dimensional theory with translation, rotation, and dilation invariance is given at the end of the present chapter.",

abstract="The approach for studying Conformal Field Theories is somewhat different from the usual approach for Quantum Field Theories. Because, instead of starting with a classical action for the fields and quantising them via the canonical quantisation or the path integral method, one employs the symmetries of the theory. In the spirit of the so-called boot-strap approach, for CFTs one defines and for certain cases even solves the theory just by exploiting the consequences of the symmetries. Such a procedure is possible in two dimensions because the algebra of infinitesimal conformal transformations in this case is very special: it is infinite dimensional.",

Destroying the unphysical higher symmetries, a representation of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group is derived with the following new features: i) The translation operators have intrinsic parts, viz. the combinations (1 + γ5)γi; ii) Consequently there are additional restrictions on the four-field interaction, the only possible combination being {fx368-01}. If one of the four fields transforms like an ordinary Dirac spinor, or if ψA and ψD transform in this way, while the other fields belong to the representation with intrinsic translations, then the constant as must vanish, and the interaction is of the type suggested by Feynman and Gell-Mann.}

We utilize the idea of interpolating the instant form dynamics (IFD) and the light-front dynamics (LFD) to realize the relativistic quantum invariance of QED and QCD. Reviewing the connection between LFD and IFD using the idea of interpolating the two different forms of the relativistic dynamics, one can learn the distinguished features of each form and how one may utilize those distinguished features in solving the complicated relativistic quantum field theoretic problems more effectively. This review aims at presenting the basic first-hand knowledge of connecting the IFD and the LFD using the idea of interpolation, and demonstrating explicit examples of its utility in QED and QCD.}

A short discussion of the conformal group in four dimensions and of the topology, introduced into the pseudo-euclidean space by this group is given. With the help of the commutation relations the spectrum of the generators in Hilbert-space is investigated. We find that the only possible discrete eigenvalue of P2 and of the Pv’s is zero and that the generator for scale transformations S has a continuous spectrum. The eigenfunctions of S in the x-representation are calculated, they form a complete set. The conservation laws valid in an invariant theory and the commutation relations predict a certain form of the conserved quantities expressed in terms of the energy-momentum tensor and of the co-ordinates. For scalar, spinor and vector fields the generators are derived by the action principle of Schwinger.}

A 2 x 2 matrix formalism is developed in view of obtaining a synthetic expression for conformai transformations as well as for spinor equations of Dirac's type. A direct proof of the conform-invariance of the new equation is then given with the aid of this formalism and an explicit transformation law for the wave function is derived. It is further shown that the unquantized equation allows for the propagation of plane waves corresponding to particles of different rest masses.},

abstract = { Abstract Aspects of the conformal group in two-dimensional Minkowski space-time are reviewed. Representations of the algebra and of the group, i. e. of infinitesimal generators and of finite group elements, are given within a field theoretic Schrödinger representation for bosons and fermions. The role of self-dual fields in representing conformal transformations is stressed, their kinematics and dynamics are shown to obey the Hill-Feynman boson-fermion duality. }
